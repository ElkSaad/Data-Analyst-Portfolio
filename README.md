# Saad El Kharraz Data Analyst Porfolio

This repository contains all the projects I've done. Some were made under the "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate" and the "Udemy - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" courses.

Each folder contains a short description of the project objective.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.
